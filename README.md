# SkunkWerkz
The W00tma5ter and Gmtisrad collaboration project!

## To Build Your Docker Image
1. Ensure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM (v13.8.0 at the time of writing)
..* I use NVM for this 
2. Ensure you have docker and docker-compose installed. Apparently this is already done in Windows, but I'm not 100% sure!
3. Go into `SkunkWerkz/docker` and run `$ docker-compose up`
4. You'll need to wait for everything to compile, roughly 1 minute or so.
5. [Your docker instance is now bridged to your machine through port 3000.](`http://localhost:3000`)
